The Robotic Development Kit is a set of java libraries designed to allow anyone from the casual experimenter to the professional robotisist to quickly prototype, simulate, and build high quality robot projects.

The RDK will abstract the hardware, software (both low level apis and high level logic) so that the robot designer can focus on the behavior and functionallity of the robotic project.

Additionally, the RDK will be able to access a Robotics development library that will include behaviors, logic, and resources that will enable the designer to contribute and leverage the community knowledge base.
